	<h3>Waterfalls in Sri Lanka</h3>
	<p>Sri Lanka as a nation is abundant in natural resources - beaches, the ocean, forests, hills, valleys, rivers and also waterfalls.
	With more than 30 waterfalls in Sri Lanka above the height of 10 m, Sri Lanka is a treasure trove for all these mesmerising cascades that it keeps safe in its nooks and corners.
	Waterfalls aren't favoured in just one district or environment, one can find at least a handful of these waterfalls, no matter where in Sri Lanka they are travelling to.
	</p>
	<p>May it be an elegantly cascading beauty that requires a few hours of hiking to reach, or a gushing mass of impatient waterfall you randomly encounter by the roadside, Sri Lanka has it all covered.
	Having the highest waterfall density in the world with a recorded 382 waterfalls spread throughout the country, Sri Lanka is the place to be to see all kinds of waterfalls.
	Fed by two half-yearly monsoons, rivers rush down the rocky precipices and form spectacular waterfalls. Only some of these picturesque waterfalls can be viewed with ease as the others are 
	located inside thick forests and around tea plantations.
	</p>
	<p>The waterfalls in Sri Lanka are well distributed and are not confined to the hill country. Colombo District has four waterfalls; two of which are just four meterseach, with the others being 10m and 15m.
	Kurunegala District has just one of six meters andGampaha and Hambantota districts have two each.
	The largest number of waterfalls are in the Ratnapura district (109) followed by Nuwara Eliya (75) and Kegalle (40). Some of the waterfalls have interesting folk tales and legends attached to them.
